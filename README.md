# Novaworks Snake: DCL Game Jam 2022

![](preview.gif)

Based on the famous Snake game. Created for the [Decentraland Game Jam 2022](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/the-2022-decentraland-game-jam-is-here/) 

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

Download this example and navigate to its directory, then run:

```
$  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

**Scene Usage**

On stage you will see a play area surrounded by walls and a wooden platform from where you can see the entire section.

Inside that area you can control a hungry snake. Mantain pressed shift to move it with WASD or use the arrows in the UI.

The goal is to eat the apples that appear on the stage. But be careful! Each apple increases the size of your snake.

If you hit your head against your tail, against a wall or against a tree, the game will restart.

## DCL Edit

We were happy to use DCL Edit to create the graphic part of the scene. You can try it [here](https://dcl-edit.com/).
